FaST-reference will generate a complete refereence for the species of choice (currently only human and mouse are supported)

Usage:

FaST-reference -s <species>  [ -v gencode_version | -f genome.fa -g annotation.gtf ] 

Options:
-s	Mandatory. Currently either 'human' or 'mouse'.
-v	Optional, gencode annotation version (i.e. 'v46' for human version 46, 'vM25' for mouse version 25).
	If omitted and no fasta or gtf are selected, the latest Gencode release for the selected species will be downloaded.
-f	Optional. Path to a fasta file corresponding to the species of interest. 
	If omitted, the latest Gencode data for the selected species will be downloaded.
-g	Optional, Path to gtf format file containing transcriptome annotation for the selected species.
	If omitted, the latest Gencode data for the selected species will be downloaded.
	
If you do not have a local fasta and gtf file, internet connection will be required to download gencode data.
If specifying a local fasta and/or gtf file please make sure that they correspond to the same genome assembly.
If specifying only a fasta (or gtf) file, please make sure that they match the same genome assembly of
the Gencode gtf (or fasta) that FaST-reference will download (the latest available if -v is omitted)
