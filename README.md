# FaST
Fast analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics

FaST is designed to allow quick analysis of large spatial transcriptomics datasets based on the 
repurposing of the Illumina flow-cell as an RNA capture device. Published protocols supported by FaST
include OpenST, seqscope and novascope.

Requirements:

bash shell environment

bedtools v2.30.0 or later

samtools v1.19.2

STAR v2.7.11a or later 

spateo-release v1.0.2 (for RNA segmentation only)
